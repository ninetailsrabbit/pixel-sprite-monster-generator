# Getting started 🚀

## Features 👾

- **Create monsters directly in your scene:** Generate unique pixel art monsters at runtime using a dedicated node in your Godot scene tree.
- **Customize with ease:** Exportable parameters allow you to fine-tune the monster generation process, tailoring them to your specific needs.
- **One node, one monster:** Each node represents a single monster, making your scene organization and workflow efficient
